## Install

Open ulauncher preferences window -> extensions -> add extension and paste the following url:

- Before usage you need to configure your Github "access_token" in plugin preferences. You can get one [here](https://github.com/settings/tokens).

### Keywords

Besides the main "gh" keyword, which triggers the main extension workflow, this extension have some other keywords that allows you access some of most used actions quickly.

## Development

```
git clone https://github.com/mt-system/ulauncher-github
make link
```

The ```make link``` will create a symbolic link to the ulauncher extensions folder.

Next, stop Ulauncher if running and run the following command:

```
make dev
```

This will start Ulauncher from the command line with all extensions disabled. In the output you will see something like this:

```
 VERBOSE=1 ULAUNCHER_WS_API=ws://127.0.0.1:5054/com.github.milottit.ulauncher-github PYTHONPATH=/usr/lib/python3.8/site-packages /usr/bin/python3 /home/$USER/.local/share/ulauncher/extensions/com.github.milottit.ulauncher-github/main.py
```

Run this, command in another terminal window, to laucnh the GitHub Extension.
